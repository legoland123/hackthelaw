      "full_content": "Court of Appeal held (at [90], [93], [102] and [107]), in relation to the then-equivalent provision to s 48O of the PDPA, that while s 48O(1) of the PDPA does not exclude emotional distress from the meaning of \u201closs and damage\u201d, a \u201cstrict causal link\u201d is required for such a claim to succeed. This means that the \u201closs or damage\u201d (including emotional distress) must have been suffered \u201cdirectly as a result of a contravention\u201d of the PDPA [emphasis in original]. Such a requirement serves as a control mechanism to prevent individuals from commencing frivolous lawsuits against organisations even for minor or technical breaches of the PDPA. 77 In my view, the DJ did not err in applying the strict causal link test stringently (Judgment at [89]). As the DJ correctly observed (Judgment at [90]), such an approach also coheres with Parliament\u2019s intent (see Second Reading at p 832): The [Personal Data Protection] Bill also allows individuals to seek compensation for damages directly suffered from a breach of the data protection rules through private rights of action. [emphasis added] 78 Applying this test, I agree with the DJ that SKM\u2019s breach of the PDPA did not directly lead to the purported emotional distress suffered by Mr Piper arising from Ms Loi\u2019s filing of her POHA claim against him and her publication of the process via the Album (Judgment at [94]\u2212[100]). In this regard, I broadly accept SKM\u2019s argument (see [32] above) that Ms Loi\u2019s actions broke the chain of causation between SKM\u2019s breach and Mr Piper\u2019s purported emotional distress, much like a novus actus interveniens in the context of common law torts. As observed in Gary Chan Kok Yew & Lee Pey Woan, The Law of Torts in Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) at para 07.078, in assessing whether the intervening action of a third party constitutes a novus actus interveniens sufficient to break the chain of causation at law, it is relevant to consider the likelihood of the third party\u2019s act occurring: In order that the chain [of causation] is not broken by a novus actus interveniens, it has been said that the alleged intervention of human action must be something likely to occur, or the risks of such a happening was \u201cglaringly obvious\u201d, or there was \u201cmanifest and obvious risk\u201d. [emphasis in original omitted] 79 In the present case, while I have earlier found (at [69] above) that one would reasonably expect the possibility of a person who is the subject of a complaint taking some form of retaliatory action against the complainant if the latter\u2019s identity is leaked to the former, I do not think that Ms Loi\u2019s retaliatory behaviour, ie, to have commenced an action against Mr Piper and to have documented this process publicly via the Album, can be said to be \u201clikely to occur\u201d or \u201cglaringly obvious\u201d, or to have posed a \u201cmanifest and obvious risk\u201d. My finding is bolstered by Mr Piper\u2019s submission that Ms Loi had, in publicly documenting the process of her POHA claim, further revealed details such as Mr Piper\u2019s surname and the case number assigned to her POHA claim (through which Mr Piper\u2019s identity can be established through a search of the hearing list via the Judiciary\u2019s website).51 ##### Foot Note 51 \u00d7 Piper\u2019s AEIC at para 56. 80 Given this, I find that Ms Loi\u2019s behaviour broke the legal chain of causation between SKM\u2019s breaches of the PDPA and the purported emotional distress suffered by Mr Piper. Indeed, I note that Mr Piper has commenced his own POHA claim against Ms Loi on 27 July 2023. 52 ##### Foot Note 52 \u00d7 Piper\u2019s AEIC at para 63(a). For the avoidance of doubt, I make no comment on this claim in this judgment. Whether Mr Piper suffered any loss actionable under s 48O of the PDPA 81 I turn to consider Mr Piper\u2019s second broad argument, that he suffered emotional distress actionable under s 48O of the PDPA due to SKM\u2019s breaches of the PDPA per se. Preliminarily, I accept that this head of damages could have been better pleaded (see [33] above). However, I also note that Mr Piper has pleaded that SKM\u2019s \u201cresponse \u2026 in respect of its PDPA breaches exacerbated the emotional distress\u201d he suffered, 53 ##### Foot Note 53 \u00d7 See ROA at p 379 paras 22\u221224. which could, when interpreted charitably, be understood as averring that he suffered actionable emotional distress due to SKM\u2019s breaches per se. I hence proceed to consider this argument substantively. 82 I am unable to find that Mr Piper suffered actionable emotional distress. In Reed, the"
