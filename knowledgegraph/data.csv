c2,Tsang Po Mann v Tsang Ka Kit,"Focused on the definition of a “data user” under the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance and obligations not to contravene data protection principles without prescribed consent. Addressed liability for damage, including emotional distress, under section 66.","The Court found that a data user who contravenes PDPO provisions can be liable for damages, including injury to feelings, and clarified the scope of liability and protections afforded by the Ordinance."
C3,Vidal-Hall v Google Inc [2016] QB 1003,"Claimants alleged that Google unlawfully tracked their internet usage, constituting misuse of private information, breach of confidence, and breach of the UK Data Protection Act 1998. Central issues included whether misuse of private information was a tort, whether damages under s.13 DPA were limited to pecuniary loss, and whether “personal data” was engaged.","Court of Appeal held that misuse of private information is a tort; “damage” under the DPA includes non-pecuniary loss such as distress; and section 13(2) of the DPA must be disapplied to comply with EU law. Appeal dismissed, allowing claims for misuse of private information and breach of data protection to proceed."
